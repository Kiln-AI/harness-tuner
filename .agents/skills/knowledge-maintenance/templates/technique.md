## When to use

<!-- The design patterns, goals and failure modes that suggest this technique. State the condition of each. -->

{{TEXT}}

## When not to use

<!-- The conditions under which it does not help, and the problems that look like its problem and are not. -->

{{TEXT}}

## Alternatives

<!-- A list. Each item links to another technique and states when that one is the better choice. Or the line "None." -->

- [{{TECHNIQUE_TITLE}}]({{TECHNIQUE_ID}}.md), when {{TEXT}}

## How

<!-- The recipe, with examples where we have them. Link each lever in `levers`, and no other lever. Do not copy how-to text that the lever or an authoring skill already has. -->

The change is one edit of the [{{LEVER_TITLE}}](../levers/{{LEVER_ID}}.md).

## Check that it took effect

<!-- How to tell, before the evals are paid for, that the change reached the agent and did what it was built to do: a probe, or a count in a few traces. -->

{{TEXT}}

## Budget

<!-- When to leave it out on a small budget, and when it is a good first step. -->

{{TEXT}}

## If it does not move the evals

<!-- Start with one of the three phrases "Keep it.", "It must move an eval." or "It depends.", then give the conditions. -->

{{STANCE}} {{TEXT}}

## Priors

<!-- A list of real cases, or the line "None yet." Each case is one list item: "- **<shape of the agent, with no name>.** <what was tried>. <what happened>. One sample, not a rule." and then, on the next line, "Source: <public | own experiment | anonymised>. <date>." A person approves a prior before it is committed, unless it is clearly public. -->

None yet.

## Confidence

<!-- Text, with its conditions: how sure we are, and on what basis. A reader must be able to tell an idea that one person proposed from a result seen many times. -->
