"""readonly_guard — the read-only variant of a read-write tool.

For a read scenario on a write-capable rc, a spurious POST is an
experiment-invalidating side effect. This variant forwards GET and refuses
everything else with the name of the tool that does writes, so the model
knows where writes go and that this tool is not it.

tool_description: "Read-only access to the subject API (GET only). Use
this for every lookup; writes are refused here — use <write tool name>
only when the user asked for a change."
