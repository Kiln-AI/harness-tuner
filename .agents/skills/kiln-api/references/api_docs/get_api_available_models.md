## Schemas

### StructuredOutputMode

Enumeration of supported structured output modes.

- json_schema: request json using API capabilities for json_schema
- function_calling: request json using API capabilities for function calling
- json_mode: request json using API's JSON mode, which should return valid JSON, but isn't checking/passing the schema
- json_instructions: append instructions to the prompt to request json matching the schema. No API capabilities are used. You should have a custom parser on these models as they will be returning strings.
- json_instruction_and_object: append instructions to the prompt to request json matching the schema. Also request the response as json_mode via API capabilities (returning dictionaries).
- json_custom_instructions: The model should output JSON, but custom instructions are already included in the system prompt. Don't append additional JSON instructions.
- default: let the adapter decide (legacy, do not use for new use cases)
- unknown: used for cases where the structured output mode is not known (on old models where it wasn't saved). Should lookup best option at runtime.
