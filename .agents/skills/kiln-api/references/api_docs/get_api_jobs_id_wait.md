# Wait For Job

**GET /api/jobs/{id}/wait**

**Tags:** Jobs

Block until the job reaches a terminal state, then return its record.

A pure observer, like the SSE stream: if the client disconnects, uvicorn
cancels this handler coroutine, which cancels the wait() await and tears
down only the awaiter — the job's supervising task keeps running.
