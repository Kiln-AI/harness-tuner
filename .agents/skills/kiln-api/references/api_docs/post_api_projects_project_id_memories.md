|id|one of: string or null|Unique identifier for this record.|
|path|one of: string or null|File system path where the record is stored.|

|overview|string|One-line summary written so a future reader can decide whether to fetch the full content. For very short memories this IS the whole memory (leave content null). No newlines. <=280 chars|
|content|one of: string or null|The memory body: the finding/fact/decision with its conditions and evidence level, citing related Kiln records as prose IDs (e.g. 'run_config 424242901234', 'eval 5678'). Null when the overview says everything. Record observations with conditions ('batch API 429'd at 50rps on 07-04'), never universal rules.|
|tags|array of string|Snake_case tags for filtering (existing Kiln tag rules). Free-form; skills define the working vocabulary (e.g. experiment, dead_end, constraint, api_quirk, session_state; faceted tags like lever_prompt, verdict_accept, evidence_weak).|
