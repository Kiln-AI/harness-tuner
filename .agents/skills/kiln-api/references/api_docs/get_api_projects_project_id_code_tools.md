## Schemas

### KilnArtifactProvenance

Why this artifact exists and what it was derived from.

Written once at creation; immutable thereafter (enforced at the API layer).
Compile-time metadata for future agent sessions and humans — never shown to
runtime models (not part of any tool/prompt surface).

|Field|Type|Required|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|notes|one of: string or null|No|Why this artifact exists: the problem/hypothesis it addresses, what changed vs. the derived_from_ids parents, what validation/evidence supports it (cite eval/run_config/trace IDs inline), and known limits. First line = one-sentence summary. Record observations with conditions, never universal rules. Max ~2000 chars.|
|derived_from_ids|array of one of: string or null|No|IDs of same-type sibling artifacts this one was derived from. Ordered: first = primary parent (the artifact this replaces or is a new version of); further entries = additional sources merged in. Empty = not derived. IDs resolve among siblings in the same parent scope only.|
|origin|one of: string or null|No|Whose judgment created this artifact. 'human': a person authored it directly OR an agent created it fulfilling a direct human request. 'agent': an agent created it autonomously. None: unknown/legacy. Required when this provenance is created; consumers must tolerate unknown values.|
