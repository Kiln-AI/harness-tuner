# The attached tools

## What it is

A run config attaches tools in `tools_config.tools`, a list of tool ids. The
model sees the name, the description and the parameters of each attached
tool in every call. This lever is the list itself: which of the tools that
already exist the agent gets. It adds no tool and changes no tool.

The tool id forms:

- `kiln_tool::code::<code_tool_id>`: a code tool of the project.
- `mcp::local::<server_id>::<tool_name>` and
  `mcp::remote::<server_id>::<tool_name>`: a tool of a connected MCP server.
- `kiln_task::<tool_server_id>`: another Kiln task, called as a tool.
- `kiln_tool::rag::<rag_config_id>`: the search tool of a RAG config.
- Built-in tools, with the `kiln_tool::` prefix.

A skill is attached in the same list, as `kiln_tool::skill::<skill_id>`. A
skill is the lever [skill](skill.md), not this one.

## How the tuner changes it

1. Read the parent's list: `get_run_config` gives `tools_config.tools`.
2. Read what can be attached: `list_available_tools` gives each tool set
   with its `type`, and each tool with its id, name and `function_name`.
   `get_tool_definition` gives the description and the parameters that
   the model sees. `list_code_tools` gives the project's code tools.
3. Create a new run config with `create_run_config`. Copy every property
   of the parent, and set the changed `tools_config.tools`.

Rules of the object:

- **The properties of a run config are fixed when it is created.** A new
  list is a new run config.
- **A new description is not this lever.** The description of an attached
  tool cannot change on the run config. A new description is a new tool: a
  clone of a code tool, or a wrapper of any tool. That is the lever
  [new_tool](new_tool.md).
- **Two tools with one job on one run config** give the model a choice.
  When a new tool replaces an old one, the old id is dropped on the same
  run config.

## Limits

- The tuner attaches only what exists. It cannot connect an MCP server,
  and it cannot create a RAG config or a Kiln task tool.
- When a dropped tool is still named in the prompt or in an attached
  skill, the text points at nothing. Code looks for such names after the
  build (the reference check). The build searches the text for the name
  and changes each mention.
- A code tool can call a tool that it lists in its `tool_allowlist` when
  that tool is not attached. To drop a tool from the model's view does not
  remove it from a wrapper.
- Never attach a tool that can reach the Kiln server to the subject task.
  It gives the subject model a channel into the Kiln API.
