# Failure at a tool call

## Situation

The failure is at the moment the agent calls a tool. Find the failing
message in the trace, and where it is compared with the tool calls:

- **before** a tool call: a preamble or a promise that the task does not
  want, written just before the call;
- **with** a tool call: a narration that rides in the same message as the
  call;
- **after** a tool's result: the reply ignores or restates the result in a
  way that the task does not want.

Naming the decision point is process. The planner's skill
(`kiln-harness-tuner-batch-selection`, Step 1) and the analyzer's skill
(`kiln-harness-tuner-experiment-analysis`, the `findings` field) give it:
the analyzer writes before, with or after which tool, and the planner
chooses the text to change. Before or with a call, that text is the
tool's description. After a call, it is the tool's response, and a rule
about the reply in general goes in the tool's description.

## What to try, in order

1. [New tool description](../techniques/new-tool-description.md), when the
   failing message is before or with the call. A code tool gets a new
   description on a clone. Any other tool gets one through a wrapper. The
   rule moves from the prompt into the description, on the same arm.
2. [Directive in the tool response](../techniques/directive-in-the-tool-response.md),
   when the failing message is after the call, or step 1 did not hold. A
   wrapper whose response states derived facts, a fixable error, or how
   the tool works, as facts about the result.

## What not to do yet

- No prompt rule, no change to a skill body and no change to a skill
  description for a failure at the call, while the tool's text can carry
  the rule. This is a very strong preference. Text in a tool moves with
  the tool. So a later experiment that adds, removes or changes a tool needs
  no prompt change, and its result stays clean. A prompt rule about a tool
  ties the prompt to the tool set, and a later change of the tools can
  leave it out of date. Also, the description applies to that one tool,
  and a prompt list of tool rules grows with the tool set.
- Do not plan a third text change on the same issue after two failed:
  [change the surface, not the words](change-the-surface-not-the-words.md).

## Budget

The order does not change with the budget. Step 1 has a low cost, and
step 2 a medium cost.
