# Lost in long instructions

## Situation

The instructions hold what the item needs, and the agent does not act on
it. The prompt, or an attached skill that is one long file, is long and
holds many topics. Signs in the traces and the outputs:

- the output misses a part that the instructions state: a property that
  must be present, a rule in the middle of the text;
- different items miss different parts;
- the agent follows a rule from the wrong topic, or two rules that
  disagree;
- the task has no tools, and the eval is scored by a judge on long free
  text (a rubric, a summary, an extraction).

This is not a missing requirement: the text asks for the part. When the
text does not ask for it, see
[a requirement is missing from the prompt](requirement-missing-from-the-prompt.md).

First, ask a probe whether this model opens a skill, or calls a tool,
under this run config and its output mode. The answer decides between the
first two steps.

## What to try, in order

1. [Long prompt into a skill](../techniques/long-prompt-into-a-skill.md),
   when the probe says that the model reads skills, and each run needs only
   some of the topics. A short prompt, a router body with one line per
   file, one reference file per topic, and a path index in the description
   with the key terms of each file. A second arm can trim the prompt to the
   router.
2. [Structure a long prompt](../techniques/structure-a-long-prompt.md),
   when the probe says no, or the task has no tools, or most runs need most
   of the content. Topics under headings, the parts that must be present
   marked, and a last step that checks each required property before the
   answer.
3. [Rewrite an inherited skill](../techniques/rewrite-an-inherited-skill.md),
   when the long text is a skill that the baseline attaches: split it into
   reference files, restructure it, or remove what contradicts the task,
   as a new version of the skill.
4. [Prune one group at a time](../techniques/prune-one-group-at-a-time.md),
   when the text is long because of rules that may not help: remove one
   group on each arm and measure it.

When structure is not enough and the task has no tools, a step outside the
model can take over a check, for example a second pass over the draft. No
technique document covers it yet.

## What not to do yet

- Do not rewrite the long text in place and call it a fix. A shorter
  version of one long text has the same problem.
- Do not assume that the model will open a skill or call a tool. The probe
  settles it for a small cost.
- Do not change the output mode on the same arm. A change of the output
  mode is a lever of its own, and it can break other items.
- Do not let a router narrate an order of reads ("load X first"). It
  changes the order of the calls, and that can change items that the arm
  was not aimed at. Measure a skill bundle against every active eval, not
  only its target.

## Budget

On a small budget, step 2 comes first when the content must stay in the
prompt: it has a low cost. Step 1 and step 3 have a medium cost.
