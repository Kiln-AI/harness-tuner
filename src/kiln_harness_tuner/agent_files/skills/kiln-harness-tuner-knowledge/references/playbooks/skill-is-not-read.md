# The skill is not read

## Situation

A skill holds what the failing items need, and the agent does not use it.
Look at the tool calls that open a skill or read one of its files:

- **not opened**: no call opens the skill in the failing items;
- **opened, file not found**: the agent opens the skill and does not load
  the reference file it needs, or it reads a path that does not exist, or
  a file near the right one;
- **read, not followed**: the agent loads the right file, and its answer
  does not do what the file says.

Each case has its own fix, so name the case first. A probe settles at a
low cost whether this model opens skills at all under this run config.

## What to try, in order

1. [Path index in the skill description](../techniques/path-index-in-the-skill-description.md),
   when the agent opens the skill and misses the file, or guesses a path.
   A new version of the skill whose description lists the full path of
   each reference file, with its key terms, and says that no other paths
   exist.
2. [One general rule per edit](../techniques/one-general-rule-per-edit.md),
   when the agent does not open the skill: one prompt rule that says which
   requests need the skill.
3. [Skill into the prompt](../techniques/skill-into-the-prompt.md), when a
   probe shows that the model does not open skills under this run config,
   or the skill is small, or most runs need it. The content, or a compact
   index of it, is then always in the context.
4. [Policy as step-by-step procedures](../techniques/policy-as-step-by-step-procedures.md),
   when the agent reads the right file and does not follow it, and the
   file is prose. Numbered steps with yes-or-no conditions are easier to
   follow. When the skill is an inherited one, the change is a new
   version:
   [rewrite an inherited skill](../techniques/rewrite-an-inherited-skill.md).

## What not to do yet

- Do not make the `SKILL.md` body longer. The body is read after the
  decision that fails: the agent does not open the skill, or opens it and
  picks a file from the description.
- Do not assume that the agent reads a skill because it is attached. Count
  the reads in a few traces, or ask a probe.
- When the agent loads the skill and does not follow it, do not add more
  text to the skill. More text gives the model more to miss. A shorter,
  more procedural text, or the content in the prompt, is the next arm.
  When the model is a lever, a model that follows long guidance better
  is another option.

## Budget

The order does not change with the budget. Steps 1 to 3 have a low cost.

## Priors

- **A coding agent with the documentation of a web framework.** A skill
  held the documentation. In 56% of the eval cases the agent never invoked
  the skill, and the pass rate was the same as with no documentation
  (53%). An explicit instruction to use the skill raised the pass rate to
  79%. A compact index of the documentation, always in the context, in
  the agent's instruction file, reached 100%. One sample, not a rule.

- **Several models as the same agent, on a benchmark of tasks with
  skills.** A 32B open model loaded at least one skill in 0.251 of its
  runs, against 0.957 for a frontier model. A larger open model loaded
  skills in 0.961 of its runs, and was judged to follow the loaded skill
  in only 0.350 of them. One sample, not a rule.
