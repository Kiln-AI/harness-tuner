# Too many tools

## What it is

The agent has more tools than the reference count, and the definition of
each tool is in the context of every call. The tool definitions then take a
large part of the context before the agent reads the request. Each call
pays for them, and at each step the agent chooses among all of them. This
is a property of the design, whether an eval passes or fails.

## How to recognise it

In the harness:

- the code detection in your input gives the number of attached tools and
  the reference it was compared with. Skills are not counted.

In how the agent runs:

- the tool definitions are a large part of the input of each call;
- the agent calls a few of the tools, and most of them are never called.

## How to confirm it

- Check that the tools are all in context on each call: they are attached
  to the run config, not found through a search tool.
- The reference is a default, not a measured optimum. Read the
  detection's source before you state how sure you are.
- **Not this smell:** tools that load only when the agent finds them, for
  example through tool search. Their definitions are not in each call. For
  that design, see [tool search](tool-search.md).
- Tools that overlap or are never called are a second smell,
  [unnecessary tools](unnecessary-tools.md). Report it on its own, with its
  trace evidence.

## What it blocks

A new tool added to the set. It is one more definition among many on each
call, and its effect is hard to see.

## Remedies

- [Fit the tool layer to the agent](../playbooks/fit-the-tool-layer-to-the-agent.md),
  first, when the fit is justified for the agent overall. It gives the
  order across the tool smells: remove or scope tools, then consolidate
  them.
- [Remove or scope tools](../techniques/remove-or-scope-tools.md), when
  the traces show tools that this task does not use.
- [Consolidate tools](../techniques/consolidate-tools.md), when the tools
  that remain are still many and each is needed for part of the work: a
  few general wrappers by job, in an arm that makes this change alone.
