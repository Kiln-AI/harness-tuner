# Fixed call chain

## What it is

The agent calls the same tools in the same order on each run, and it
passes an id or a value from one result to the next call. The model runs
again between each two calls, but it decides nothing new. Each step costs
a turn and context, and each step is one more place where the agent can
pass a wrong value or stop. The tools are made for software, which calls
them in a chain at no cost. This is a property of the design, whether an
eval passes or fails.

## How to recognise it

In the harness:

- tools that each return one part of a record, and take the id of another
  part as input, for example find the user, then get the account, then
  list its orders.

In how the agent runs:

- the same order of tool calls on most sampled items;
- each call takes its main argument from the result before it;
- between two calls of the chain, the model writes a short turn or no
  text at all.

## How to confirm it

- In the sampled traces, write the order of the tool calls of each run,
  and compare them.
- Check where each argument comes from.
- **Not this smell:** an order that changes with the data, where the agent
  chooses the next tool from what it read. That chain carries decisions.

## What it blocks

Nothing.

## Remedies

- [Roll-up tool](../techniques/roll-up-tool.md), when the chain is the
  same on most runs: one code tool that makes the calls in code and
  returns what the agent uses.
- [Fit the tool layer to the agent](../playbooks/fit-the-tool-layer-to-the-agent.md),
  when other smells of the tools are present too.
